# DatabaseHelper
A small tool to make using databases easier.

This is not meant for any complex queries, it is mostly just for representing SQL statements as code and 
prevent some mistakes in formatting statements.

As I have not set up a WIKI yet, if you want to see examples you can look at the [tests](https://github.com/FisherLuba/DatabaseHelper/blob/main/src/test/kotlin/io/github/fisherl/databasehelper/AnimalDatabaseTest.kt).
# TODO
- Setup testing to connect to actual database
- Add more SQL Dialects
- Add documentation
- Add wiki
- Publish to a maven repository
